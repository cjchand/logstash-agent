# If the message is not RFC5424 [1] compliant, then Logstash will add a tag with value "_grokparsefailure_sysloginput". 
# As you can imagine, this means that the standard Logstash syslog-specific Grok patterns failed to match on your message.
# The configuration below will strip out all syslog-specific fields Logstash attempts to add, as we can not rely on those
# values to be valid. This helps avoid false-positives. 
# 
# filter {
#     if "_grokparsefailure_sysloginput" in [tags] {
#         mutate {
#             remove_field => [ "facility", "facility_label", "priority", "severity", "severity_label" ]
#         }
#     }
